    Types of negative thoughts

  <h3>
    <u>Tension/Worry</u>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Once a wealthy man went to psychologist,
    <br>
    <b>man</b>:I am having lot of tension, what to do.
    <br>
    <b>doctor</b>:Well as you are wealthy and can afford great many luxurious why don't you hire a person.
    <br>
    <b>man</b>:For what?
    <br>
    <b>doctor</b>:For taking all your tensions. :)
    <br>
    <br>
    Two things are to be taken fronm this joke

    <ul>
      <li>
        This problem often happen to the person who has every thing required to live a happy life, the people who struggle
        in life do not know what tension is.
      </li>
      <li>
        Other being, this tension is pointless as no one can even understand it. It is the useless creation of our our mind,
        only we can clean it.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>
    <u>OverThinking/Anxiety</u>
  </h3>
  <p>
    -If you keep talking to someone else in your mind then it is called as overthinking. It is 99% bad for our health, just
    take a pause for one moment and think does talking to someone in your head will will lead you somewhere? the answer
    you must have got is <strong>NO</strong>, so why do it!. Now the truth is we indulge in overthinking often when we are
    afraid of confronting a situation, see this is how our mind plays with us. It let us talk away from situation but when we are
    present in that situation chances are it won't help!. This is the normal behaviour of an untrained mind, we just have to
    train our mind the same way we train our muscles to be strong.
    <br>
    <br>
    We have to train our mind in not to indulge in overthinking, then we can face the actual scenario with more confidence.
    if you are talking to someone else in your mind the reason may be the other person is too adamant or ignorant, just leave
    it there. May be the other person is not worth or it will understand after some time. Whatever be the reason of the
    behaviour of other person, overthinking will harm only you and not the other person. In such scenarios take 2 minutes
    decide what ever you feel is correct and come out of that situation. Get yourself busy in some other activity.

Mindfullness is a practise which can be brought into life. We do not need any reason to be happy.
