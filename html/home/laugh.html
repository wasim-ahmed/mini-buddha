<h3><i>Remember when you have nothing to contribute you absorb.</i></h3>
  When you are in difficult situation it is normal to have <b>stress</b>. The thing is you are accepting stress because
    you are on receiving side, just focus on what you can contribute and do not absorb anything. Contribute what ever you
    can just laugh and walk away, that is the best thing you can do, being joufull is an art which can be mastered.
