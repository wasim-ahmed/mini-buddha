    <h3>A healthy body lives in a healthy mind</h3>
    <p>Do not block your mind (don't avoid your problems) rather get a clarity of what you want to do.
    What ruin us is our useless thoughts, we are often present somewhere and our mind dwells somewhere else,
    either in the regrets of the past or in worries of the future. Worrying will not lead us anywhere, we will just be ruining yourself.
    Practice mindfullness! Start practicing it and soon you shall have command on your mind.
    <br>
    <br>
    Be engaged in your day to day activities as you were before and do not overload your brain. Things may take
    time to settle down but that is the law of nature everthing happnes organically it takes time.As long as you
    are having a calm mind nothing can hurt you.</p>
    Mind traverses between problems only like among actual problem & side problems like work, career, health etc. Inspite Mind
    needs rest whcih can be obtained by mindfullness only.It was a habit which was there earlier automatically but now lost
    over a period of time, due to bad time. It can be cultivated again.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you are not working that means your mind should be resting completely i.e. zero thoughts.

    <h3>Take care of your body</h3>
    <p>No need for an agreement on this one, this is the most important thing this is you. We also need to understand
    the difference between fitness and body building. What we need is fitness, body building and good shape comes
    next. The only thing reqiured to achieve great fitness is dedication and discipline. Dedication that you are
    going to place your fitness goal above any other thing in life and we require a great amount of Discipline to
    achieve that.
    </p>
    <br>
    Discipline is of utmost importance!
    <p>
      Your health is dependent on your lifestyle & habits, what you eat, when you eat, how much you eat. When you sleep,
      how much do you sleep. How much brain you utilize, how much physical exercise you do. How well are your body cycles
      stablished. and at last how much stress do you have.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every voluntary action is subjected to addiction,identify & control it. Stop any kind of addiction it can be
        <br>
        -Working too much<br>
        -Watching too much TV<br>
        -Eating too much<br>
        -Spending too much time on social media like facebook,youtube etc<br>
        <br>
      practise simple life. Detach from everything that you own.
    </p>

  <div id="Tokyo" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Plan,it right now! A Goal without a plan is just a wish</h3>
    <p>Take a piece of paper and write down your wishes [do not delay, do it now] a simple question,
    what do you want to do in life. Take your time,Read it again what you have written and make a final draft.
    Just put on the todays date and keep it safe. Now this is what you want from life, just focus on this and
    nothing else. All you need to do is to change your dreams into reality by converting your wishes into plan
    and enforcing them by strict regulations.
  </p>
  Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Keep your own counsel. Take decision/plan & give yourself a time limit in
  which you have to take a decision.
  <br>
  What we need is a change in lifestyle & attitude.
