  <h2>
  If you are having issues in life then admit it.
</h2>
  This is just a bad time for you and the good thing about time is,it always change.
  Initial medication can help but that is not the solution because answer lies within, you only know what you want.
  You don't need anyone elses help, you need your help. This may take time but this is the only & best solution.

<h2>
Find the base reason that why you entered in the situation.
</h2>
What ever your problem is base reason is a wrong decision or un-mindedness. It may have several forms:
<br>
  <li>-Your negligence towards important matter</li><br>
  <li>-Living in a dream world</li><br>
  <li>-Too scared to confront the real world</li>

<h2>
Why this has happen to me.
</h2>
We are the result of our choices. That also means we are the architect of our own destiny.
Because we have fallen into the habit of indecision, this is bound to happen.

<div style="height:100px;background-color:Azure">
<h2>
Why this has happened to me now?
</h2>
With the decisions that you made in life this was inevitable to happen. If not now this would have happened sometimes
later in life, what difference does that makes. Just be thankful so that you can solve the issue and be a man your
always wanted to be.
