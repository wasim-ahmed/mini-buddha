<h3>Life, as we know it !</h3>
We often make our lives complex, it's our fault! . Life is all about maintaining a balance.
Always remember one thing you are the most important person in this world: <i><q>It is, because you are & nothing is, if you
are not!</q></i>
Everything heals,Your body heals, your heart heals. The mind heals, wounds heal. Your sole repair itself. Your
happiness is always going to come back. Bad time don't last. Actually we do not need any reason to be happy.

<button class="accordion"><i><strong>Nothing more can trouble us, than our own thoughts.</strong></i></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Most problem comes because of 2 reasons, We act without thinking and then we keep thinking without acting.
  Overthinking just destroys us everyone know thinking in head is not going to solve the issue.
  Just remember the most important person in this world is you.
<br>
<br>
  Mind is a good servent but a bad master. Control your body and mind or else it will control you. As feelings is the
  language of body, thought is the language of brain.

    <h5>
      <u>Tension/Worry</u>
    </h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This problem often happen to the person who has every thing required to live a happy life, the people who struggle
          in life do not know what tension is.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other being, this tension is pointless as no one can even understand it. It is the useless creation of our our mind,
          only we can clean it.

    <h5>
      <u>OverThinking/Anxiety</u>
    </h5>
    <p>
      -If you keep talking to someone else in your mind then it is called as overthinking. It is 99% bad for our health, just
      take a pause for one moment and think does talking to someone in your head will will lead you somewhere? the answer
      you must have got is <strong>NO</strong>, so why do it!. Now the truth is we indulge in overthinking often when we are
      afraid of confronting a situation, see this is how our mind plays with us. It let us talk away from situation but when we are
      present in that situation chances are it won't help!. This is the normal behaviour of an untrained mind, we just have to
      train our mind the same way we train our muscles to be strong.
      <br>
      <br>
      We have to train our mind in not to indulge in overthinking, then we can face the actual scenario with more confidence.
      if you are talking to someone else in your mind the reason may be the other person is too adamant or ignorant, just leave
      it there. May be the other person is not worth or it will understand after some time. Whatever be the reason of the
      behaviour of other person, overthinking will harm only you and not the other person. In such scenarios take 2 minutes
      decide what ever you feel is correct and come out of that situation. Get yourself busy in some other activity.

<div class="panel">
  <p>What makes us human is our inefficiency. We may be wrong sometimes we may have made wrong decisions in life but
  don't let failure sit on your head. Just smile and march ahead, it's just not your time.
  There is no need to be affected by negative energy, if you are confinde in negtivity just throw it out, there is
  absolutly no need to deal with it.
</p>

<h5>Remember when you have nothing to contribute you absorb.</h5>
  When you are in difficult situation it is normal to have <b>Stress</b>. The thing is you are accepting stress because
  you are on receiving side, just focus on what you can contribute and do not absorb anything. Contribute what ever you
  can just laugh and walk away, that is the best thing you can do, being joufull is an art which can be mastered.
  <br>
  <br>
    Make your mental defenes system strong just as immunity of body. As body require immunity from infections in similar
    manner mind needs immunity from negativity.
    <br>
    <i>My mind is my house only courage & passion lives here !</i>
    <h6>Master the art of Simplicity and gratitude. The ultimate weapon against worries</h6>

    Start taking simple joys of life as we used to do when we were kids. How curious & happy we were about everything.

  <h4>
  Symptoms
</h4>
  <dl>
  <dt><u>Falling Sensation</u></dt>
  <dd>- You ever had a feeling that you are tripping or going down. you feel that that suddenly you
  start loosing control over your body and going to fell down but it never happens!. You are always
  right there standing on your feet just feeling uncomfortable and nervous. Sounds familiar ! you ever had
  that, may be you are living in such a situation day after day and wondering what to do, as doctor
  already said that you are ok all of your medical tests are fine but you only know that
  what you are going through.Chance are people don't understand beacause to them you seems just fine as you
  have not fractured your bone which they can see and offer their sympathy
  Remember this is different situation from vertigo because in vertigo your surroundings move and you stand
  still which is contrary in this case as here surroundings are absolute stationary it is you who is shaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  This happens when you are under immense stress and living in it over & over. The brain signals the body that
  this situation is beyond your control and it is better to shutdown. This might happen more intensly  when
  you are out in public and as you come home you feel relaxed.This is just the outcome of what your mind
  feels. This is the falling sensation when you are awake.This is often termed as social anxiety too or as a
  software error of human body.
  </dd>

  <dt><u>Heartbeat Palpitation</u></dt>
  <dd>- Does it happened to you that sometimes your heart beat raises exponentially high as if you are
    going to get a cardiac arrest but you never get a heart attack you just feel nervous and after sometimes
    you just feel good, in this case too chances are your doctor has said you are just fine , all your reports
    are correct yet you only know how miserable your life has become with this issue which is not ending.
  </dd>
  </dl>

  These situations are caused when there is a imbalance in our brain, there are several hormones which gets
  disturbed when we get through rough time or having high stress. The level of happiness hormone(dopamine & serotonin)
  goes down and the level of stress hormone(cortisol) goes up. Also doctors and reports may say that your brain tonic
  (Vitamin B12) is reduced and you may need to take it externally.We need to note a very important point here: it is you
  who has let this imbalance created (reasons can be external) and it is only in our hands to get back to normal
  state.
<br>
<br>

    <Note>Note: Do not live alone,live with friend or a family</Note>

</div>

<button class="accordion"><i><strong>Do not think, just do it what it takes to get out this situation.be brave!</strong></i></button>
